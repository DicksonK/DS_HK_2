Writing Journal Reviews

Once each other week you'll be writing a journal review. Journal Reviews generally have the following sections:

Objective/Abstract: What is the paper about, and what was the goal of the paper? Hypothesis: Where any hypotheses made within the paper before the work began? If so, what was it? What did you think about it?

Style: Who was the audience of the paper, and how could that get figured out? (Some data science papers are not written for other data scientists, but more targeted towards the applied section of the paper, ie Sociologists, etc).

Methods: What methodologies did the paper use to approach its objective? How well did they work?

Conclusions: Overall assessment of the paper. This is generally broken into parts of what you thought about the material you read, do you think it was well written or poorly written, how well did it answer the questions it was looking at, and did you have any follow up questions about the data, methodologies, etc.

<h1>Objective</h1>
This journal is about how Google uses machine learning to  maximise performance and minimise energy use at their data centers. Basically Google is building a server farms that can learn from their past performance and improve themselves in the future.

The researcher builded models that take in a huge amount of data Google was already tracking about its data centers including how much energy is being used at any given time by servers and other equipment, outside air temperature etc. Computers then crunch all this numbers, analysing the inter-relationship that may be impossible for a human mind to grasp, then predicting Power Usage Effectiveness, or how to use available power most efficiently for maximum computing return.

<h1>Style</h1>
The audience of this paper is academic who have deep understanding in data science. The authors in this article explain the full process of training a neural network model into four steps which allows reader to understand how to approach the challenge.

<h1>Method</h1>

To address the challenges, Google used neural network for training DC energy efficiency models. As Neural networks are a class of machine learning algorithms that mimic cognitive behavior via interactions between artificial neurons and they are advantageous modelingling intricate systems because neural networks do not require the user to predefine the feature interactions in the model, which assumes relationships within the data. Instead, the neural network searches for patterns and interactions between features to automatically generate a best-Â­fit model.

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

In my opinion, this is indeed an interesting article, they not only just explain how the  challenges were approached, they also share some domain knowledge about Data Centre for those who does not know much about Data Centre. After reading this real world example about how data science can make positive changes, I am more excited about the up coming class.
